# Studio Ghibli App

A Vue application displaying information about Studio Ghibli films, using the Studio Ghibli API and a Google Chart.  

## How To Run

##### Commands to run in the terminal:

```
npm i
```
```
npm run serve
```
  
## Brief  

Your task is to create an application that makes a request to an API and displays the data.

### MVP

- The application should display data from an API request.
- The application should have a clear separation of concerns (multiple components)
- Take input from the user to update the page. You could update the page by filtering or manipulating the data on user interaction, or you might make further API requests to load more data that is then displayed.

### Extensions

Looking into a library to visual the data.

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is an open-source library for rendering maps
- [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) is a library for rendering charts and graphs
- [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) is a drawing surface for JavaScript.

You will need to use the library's documentation to integrate it into your application.
